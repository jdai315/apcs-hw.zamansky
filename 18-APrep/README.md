AP Prep - 5/9/14

For the period, I studied for my AP Spanish Language exam on May 22.
I worked on practice multiple choice questions on the College Board page.

(The course description, including practice questions starting on page.48)

I only worked on the Reading Comprehension portion of the exam as I couldn't play audio to practice the other parts of the test.
Each passage is generally followed by about 6 questions.
This part of the test is 30 questions long (about 5 passages) in 40 minutes.
This means that each passage should take 8 minutes; the challenge of this portion focuses on understanding in a short period of time.
